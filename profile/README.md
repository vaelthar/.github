## About Vaelthar

Vaelthar is an open-source organization dedicated to developing high-performance voxel game technology. Our mission is to create a complete, extensible ecosystem for building multiplayer block-based games and experiences that run seamlessly in modern web browsers.

The project combines cutting-edge web technologies with proven game engine architecture to deliver a developer-friendly platform that doesn't compromise on performance or features.

### Core Philosophy

**Performance First** – Optimized chunk-based rendering and physics designed for real-time multiplayer experiences  
**Developer Experience** – TypeScript-native with comprehensive type safety and modern tooling  
**Extensibility** – Plugin architecture and modular design for easy customization  
**Open Collaboration** – Community-driven development with transparent processes

---

## Our Vision

We're building the future of voxel game technology with a focus on:

**Modern Web Standards** – Leveraging the latest browser capabilities for high-performance 3D experiences  
**Scalable Architecture** – Designing systems that work from small prototypes to massive multiplayer worlds  
**Developer Tools** – Creating libraries and frameworks that make voxel game development accessible  
**Community Growth** – Fostering an ecosystem where developers can share, learn, and build together
